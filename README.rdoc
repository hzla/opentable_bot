This is a rails app that functions as an opentable reserveration bot. It is used in conjunction with the event_planner webapp. 

Calls are made to /api/v1/opentable/reserve with the appropriate opentable restauraunt ID, a time window for reservations to be made, first and last name, party size, email, and phonenumber.
